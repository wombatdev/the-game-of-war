<h1>War - reinvented</h1>

<sub>Not really.</sub>

<h3>Technologies used:</h3>

HTML (duh)
CSS (=bane)
JS/jquery

<h3>Approach Taken</h3>

I began by cannibalizing a previous HTML/CSS setup so I could focus on the code. After some thought, I created a simple array for the deck of cards, then found a good shuffle function to use. After that, it was a matter of manipulating arrays to imitate individual hands, with cards moving into a pot and being subsequently deposited into the winner's stack.

After getting the basic mechanics down, I created a solid function to handle War events; one that could loop as many times as needed for consecutive war situations.

At that point, I felt the game was mostly complete, and I started adding options (in-game shuffling & multiple decks), as well as animations. The animations alone took about twice as long to get working as the entire Javascript game.
